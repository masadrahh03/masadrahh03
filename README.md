# Welcome to my GitHub

## About Me

Hello there. I’m Habes, and this is my GitHub account. Yes, I know, it’s a bit of a surprise to find me here considering my thoughts on open-source software.

I’m a software engineer with experience at Microsoft, Apple, and Adobe, and I’ve worked on a variety of projects. However, don’t expect much from this repository. It’s not exactly a bustling open-source hub—more like a quiet corner of the internet. I dabble in projects, but my real work is not the kind that gets pushed out into public repositories.

## My Thoughts on Open Source

I’ve tried GitHub, and it’s... fine, I suppose. But honestly? I’m not a fan. The concept of open-source is overrated. Sharing your code with the world sounds nice in theory, but in practice, it just adds a whole lot of unnecessary noise. Why share everything when some things are better left private or controlled? I prefer to keep my projects within the walls of organizations that know how to properly handle proprietary code.

You won’t find a ton of contributions here, and don’t expect me to merge any pull requests. There’s no need to fork this repo either—I’m not interested in collaboration of the sort GitHub pushes.

## Contact Me

Feel free to reach out via LinkedIn (though I’m not overly active there either). You’ll find more details about me, my work experience, and other boring things that come with being in the industry for so long. You won’t catch me on GitHub much, though.

If you're still here after all that, I’m impressed. But don’t expect too much activity. This GitHub? It’s not a playground for everyone.
